                        This website was created for Core 2: Interaction Studio. In this assignment, we were asked to choose a text and create a functional website with a consistent navigation element. For my text, I chose the short story <a href="index.html"> Flowers for Algernon</a> by Daniel Keyes. This hertbreaking story is written from the perspective of the main character, Charlie Gordon. Charlie has an IQ of 68, and undergoes experimental surgery that triples his IQ. His journey is documented through a series of self-written reports.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I chose to show the reports chronologically through the months, allowing users to scroll, as well as jump to a month to see the shift in the character's writing. Some of the text is highlighted, showing important points of the story and Charlie's thought process. When hovered over, the rest of the text disappears- parallelling Charlie's eventual loss of IQ- but reappears slowly, instilling a message of hope that Charlie's contribution will lead to the surgery's success.
